# Sunbeams

Sunbeams is, first and foremost, a tool to literally brighten your day. It's a lofty goal, I know. There's a couple command line options that I truly hope put a smile on your face. Past that, work is going into making utilities that make development on projects that can subscribe to the ideology laid out here more enjoyable. Convention over configuration, as the old saying goes.

I also get that can't work for everyone or every project, and that's ok. If `sunbeams format` is too strict for your use case, use prettier, no worries. <3

## Goals

> Be fun to use.

Development, and your day, should be fun. There's actually a lot to this and it ends up being an excercise in making sure it's not -not- fun. Staying out of the way, doing what's expected, being as simple as possible, the list goes on. Also, add some joy where we can.

> Provide sane conventions.

The -LEAST- fun thing is stressing about how things should be done. There should always only be a single way to do anything; even if there are more than one, decide on one and do that. This 'way' can change when it doesn't work anymore.

> Help as much as possible.

I mean, otherwise what's the point?
