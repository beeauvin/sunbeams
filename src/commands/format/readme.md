# sunbeams/format

formatting to brighten your day

sunbeams/format is a cli tool to automatically format 'stuff' with prettier. Simply, it runs prettier (just like you would) except on all files, with predefined settings, so you don't have too.

It is opinionated and comes with no functional options.

If that's not your jam, just use prettier, it's cool. <3

## Contributing

I will accept requests that make this tool work in more places but not requests that make it work differently. IE: A change that makes it work with a particular editor or enviornment is welcome while a change that makes `--no-semi` an optional argument is not.

The goal is to run the command and move on; it works the same way in every project that uses it. Options that are provided are strictly utilities that may be useful, not behavior.
