# Sunbeams

a little something to brighten your day

## Goals

> Be fun to use.

Development, and your day, should be fun. There's actually a lot to this and it ends up being an excercise in making sure it's not -not- fun. Staying out of the way, doing what's expected, being as simple as possible, the list goes on. Also, add some joy where we can.

> Provide sane conventions.

The -LEAST- fun thing is stressing about how things should be done. There should always only be a single way to do anything; even if there are more than one, decide on one and do that. This 'way' can change when it doesn't work anymore.

> Help as much as possible.

I mean, otherwise what's the point?
